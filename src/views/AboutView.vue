    This vue todo is inspired by <b>John Komarnnicki</b>'s vue crash course from
    youtube. I have added tailwind css instead of SASS that was used in actual
    course. Also some other modifications in the code. This application just
    stores creted todos in localstorage also keep track using "watch". It is
    just a simple todo application to undestand basic concept of vue.
